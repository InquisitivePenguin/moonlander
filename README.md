# Moonlander

A simple, error-resilient interface for PX4 UAVs.

## Setup

First ensure that your Python version is 3.9 or higher:
```shell
$ python --version
Python 3.9.7
```

Next, install moonlander through pip:

```shell
$ pip3 install git+https://github.com/OSURoboticsClub/Moonlander
```

Finally, you will need a SITL (software-in-the-loop) to run this locally.
Moonlander is tested against jMAVSim, so we recommend getting that. Instructions
on how to install prerequisites for jMAVSim can be found [here](https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0_noredirect/en/setup/dev_env.html).
Then, follow [these instructions](https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0_noredirect/en/setup/building_px4.html) to build PX4 and run jMAVSim.
